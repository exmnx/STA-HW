# STA-ISLR-HW
Homework from Statistical Foundations of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence I and statistical learning some questions from the ISLR  

Note: Most questions are given by my professor, so I will mostly be explaining what I am doing. My homeworks in the beginning are simple analysis and plots. My other repositiory I am putting together will include data analysis with Random Forests, xgboosts and probably cross validation approaches.
